# Assets for Algorzen Vigil

Place screenshots used by the `README.md` here. Recommended names and sizes:

- `screenshot_overview.png` — Project overview / landing (1200×700)
- `screenshot_upload.png` — Upload screen / file picker (1000×600)
- `screenshot_results.png` — Analysis results / anomalies table (1200×800)

How to add your screenshots:
1. Export screenshots from your system or browser as PNG (recommended). Keep file names exactly as above.
2. Place the files in this folder: `docs/assets/`.
3. The `README.md` references these filenames; once present they will render on GitHub and in local Markdown viewers.

If you don't want to commit actual screenshots to the repo, leave this folder with the README and add images only for local builds.
